1. Firewall
   --------
- Block all inbound
- Block all outbound SMB connections (remote ports 137-139, 445 both TCP and UDP)

DO NOT APPLY IN A VM

2. Mitigate DNSMasq vulnerability
   ------------------------------
- Configure all devices to use a public DNS: OpenDNS, Google, etc.
- If you are really paranoid switch router connection to PPOE Bridged and do PPOE on PC.
However if you do this only that PC can be connected to Internet though.
